1) first class entities should be represented as tables as singular, eg project, person
2) no underscores in table name for first class entities
3) join tables normalizing n:n relations between two tables into two 1:n relations must contain both table names in its name.
4) all tables must have an id of the database data type that resolves to a long in java. For mysql its bigint(20). For MySQL, they should be autoincrement and for databases that support sequences, they should be linked to a sequence (not implemented).
5) foreign key reference cols must be of the form ${entityName}_id.

Notes about autocrud
1) Allows you to create the data access layer and model beans from the database schema.
2) Currently database dependent. Works with MySQL and code changes will probably be needed to work with Oracle.
